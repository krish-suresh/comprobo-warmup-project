# Computational Robotics Warm-up Project
## Project Overiew
The purpose of this project was to develop an introductory understanding of ROS (Robot Operating System), understand how sensor data can be used to dynamically change robot behavior, and develop intuition on how to debug robotic systems using a [Neato](https://neatorobotics.com/). The Neato has a wide variety of features, including odometry tracking, 360 degree LiDAR, and bump sensors, which were implemented to develop numerous robot behaviors outlined in this document.
